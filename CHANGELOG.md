# Changelog

## v1.7.6

### Added
- Immich sync gained per-server **Sync Mode** in Settings: `album` (default, existing behavior), `all` (entire library via `/api/search/metadata`), `favorites` (Immich Favorites), and `memories` ("on this day" assets via `/api/memories`). The album picker only renders when mode is `album`. Closes #32
- Home Assistant add-on store now ships an `icon.png` (128×128 tile) and `logo.png` (250×100 banner) rendered from the firmware project's icon, so the add-on shares the brand mark with the rest of the ecosystem

### Changed
- Image source dispatch refactored into a flat plugin registry (`internal/imagesource.Source` + `Registry`). Each of the eight sources (`ai_generation`, `fractal`, `dla`, `gallery`, `immich`, `synology_photos`, `google_photos`, `url_proxy`) is now its own ~30-line plugin file owning one source name; the handler does a single `registry.Fetch` with zero per-source branching. The four library-backed sources share `RunDBPhotoFlow` (exclusion-aware pick + smart collage + photo-date lookup) parameterized by per-source pick/load callbacks. Adding a new source is now one file plus one `main.go` registration. `handler/image.go` shrinks ~365 lines. Fractal and DLA generative algorithms ported from the standalone `fractalgen` and `dla` CLIs (contributor: Christopher Rowley)

### Fixed
- Gallery uploads from iPhone (and any source that writes EXIF `Orientation` instead of rotating pixels) showed up sideways on the device and in the gallery. Uploads and Google Photos sync now run `magick -auto-orient` to bake the orientation into the pixel grid and reset the tag to 1. Telegram, Immich, and Synology paths were already covered
- Smart collage on a portrait device paired a landscape first photo with a portrait (not landscape) second photo, which `DrawCover` then cropped to a wide strip — and symmetrically on landscape devices. The second-photo query now targets the slot's shape (opposite of the device) instead of the device's own orientation

## v1.7.5

### Fixed
- Gallery delete failed with HTTP 500 ("database is locked") and 26-30s latency under concurrent image fetches. SQLite is now opened in WAL mode with a 30s busy_timeout (`_journal_mode=WAL&_busy_timeout=30000&_synchronous=NORMAL`), so the per-fetch `device_history` writer no longer starves user-facing writes. The per-fetch insert + prune is also wrapped in a single transaction so the writer holds the lock once instead of three times
- Gallery `DeletePhoto` / `DeletePhotos` now drop the DB row before removing the file, so a timed-out delete can no longer leave a row pointing at a missing file. Thumbnail handler returns 404 instead of 500 when the source file is gone
- Immich users got a Synology-flavored empty-state message; each source now has its own copy that points at the correct Data Sources tab

### Changed
- Gallery card and delete UI restyled to match the device webapp: outlined cards with hover lift/shadow, photos shown at native aspect ratio inside square cards (`contain` + grey letterbox), `mdi-delete` trash-icon affordance revealed on top-right corner hover, inline delete dialogs with thumbnail preview and a destructive Delete button
- Both per-photo and "Delete All" actions now require confirmation
- Gallery shows 6 photos per row at large viewports (down from 8)

## v1.7.4

### Added
- Standalone server-side gallery: photos uploaded from the web UI or sent to the Telegram bot are stored under `data/photos/gallery/` and tracked in the images table. Telegram is now an upload path into the gallery rather than a separate source; push-to-device on bot upload still works when enabled. Migration `000022` rewrites any existing `images.source` / `settings.image_source` rows from `telegram` to `gallery`

### Changed
- Update AI model list: drop deprecated DALL-E entries, add Gemini 3.1 Flash
- Split server-owned device fields from hardware-derived ones in the device model

### Fixed
- Renderer: emit CSS `contain` for fit display mode so cropped images render correctly

### Performance
- Rewrite `device_histories` prune as a range delete so it stays O(log n) once a device's history grows past a few hundred rows

### Build
- Bump Alpine base image to 3.21 for newer libheif

## v1.7.3

### Fixed
- Device image URL is now built against the add-on port (default `9607`, configurable via `VITE_ADDON_PORT`) instead of `window.location.origin`, so the URL works when the webapp is served through Home Assistant ingress (`:8123`) but the ESP32 reaches the server directly

### Performance
- Index the hot-path GORM queries that were doing sequential scans: `api_keys(user_id)` and `(user_id, device_id)` (token lookups on every device config save), `devices(host)` (LAN fallback identification on every image fetch), and `images(source)` / `(source, synology_photo_id)` / `(source, immich_asset_id)` (per-photo dedup during Synology and Immich sync)

## v1.7.1

### Added
- Walnut photo-frame icon, used as both the favicon and a 32×32 prepend in the app-bar so the title bar reads as a branded header

### Changed
- New warm amber color palette: primary `#ce9160`, with matched-saturation error / info / success / warning (`#982f2f`, `#2f6398`, `#2f9852`, `#987e2f`)

### Fixed
- Image fetch failures propagate as errors instead of falling back to a picsum placeholder

## v1.7.0

### Added
- Remote device configuration: manage device settings from the server. The device dialog is now a tabbed UI matching the device webapp (General, Auto Rotate, Processing, Palette, Home Assistant), fetches live config from the device, and pushes changes back on Save with an offline fallback message.
- Display orientation dropdown shows resolution (e.g., "Portrait 480×800")

### Changed
- Display mode "contain" renamed to "fit" for consistency
- Image orientation detection unified across sources; orientation is passed to the CLI for device-aware processing
- Bind flow simplified: image URL and token generated on Save (no separate Bind button)

### Performance
- Cache resolved IP on photoframe client and reuse clients across fetches
- Use dns-sd for fast mDNS resolution on macOS
- Composite index on `device_histories(device_id, served_at)`
- Prune device_histories to 50 entries, remove unnecessary COUNT query

### Fixed
- Increase HTTP client timeout to 120s for image push operations
- Reuse existing device token instead of revoking and regenerating when re-binding
- Return 404 instead of 500 when no URL proxy sources are configured
- Use `--ignore-scripts` for frontend npm install to skip canvas native build

## v1.6.1

### Added
- EPDGZ format: serve compressed 4-bit-per-pixel images by default, saving bandwidth and enabling instant display rendering on the device. Automatically falls back to PNG for firmware older than v2.6.2.
- Internet operation: bind device tokens to specific device IDs for reliable identification over the internet without hostname/IP matching
- Auto-sync scheduler for Immich and Synology photo sources with configurable intervals
- Dev Container configuration for streamlined local development

### Fixed
- Synology: automatically re-login when session expires using saved device token (bypasses 2FA on trusted devices)
- Synology auto-sync UI: fix indentation in settings panel
- Device push: return 503 error when device is unreachable instead of misleading "queued" response
- Token management: add missing PUT endpoint for updating device binding on tokens
- Token backfill: skip ambiguous matches when multiple devices share the same name

## v1.6.0

### Added
- Overlay: display photo creation date from Immich EXIF metadata and Synology timestamps
- Overlay: new per-device "Show Photo Date" toggle in device settings

### Fixed
